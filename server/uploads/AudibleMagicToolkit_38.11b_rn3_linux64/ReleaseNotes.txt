Release Notes for the Audible Magic Toolkit (formerly named OEM SDK)
24 June 2019

TO ALL TOOLKIT USERS
----------------

1. Please read the release notes below for all versions more recent
than the one you have been using until now. The mentioned features and
bug fixes usually apply to all supported platforms (Linux, Windows,
macOS), even if the release in question was issued on only one or two.

2. If you would like to override the use of any of the 3rd party
libraries or executables (e.g., libcurl, ffmpeg, ffprobe) that are
packaged with the Audible Magic Toolkit release, and you have questions
about how to do so correctly on your platform, please send an email
with that request to helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.  Audible Magic's
Client Services department will then contact you and provide the
necessary details.

 
Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in this Release, Version 38.11b
(for Linux, Windows, and macOS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first general release for all customers since 31.0f.

- New config files are required for this version. If you haven't already 
been given a version 38 config file, please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.

- A number of bugs were fixed in video signature identification that
could produce false negatives in ID results.

- An error is now returned for video lookups if the video file is too short.

- The JSON now includes the unknownAssetID for local lookups, not only
for remote lookups.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 37.0 (for Linux and Windows)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- New config files are required for this version. If you haven't already 
been given a version 37 config file, please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.

- A bug was fixed in video signatures that could produce false negatives
in ID results.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 36.1b (for CentOS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- New config files are required for this version. If you haven't already 
been given a version 36 config file, please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.

- This was the first release to be called "Toolkit." The new name
reflects the fact that it's not a software development kit (SDK), in
that no header files are included, and customers instead run prebuilt
command-line programs.

- The new features of the previous release ("Cue ID") are included.

- New documentation is included (AMToolkit_Users_Guide.pdf).

- identifyMediaFile was renamed to "identify" and has updated
functionality, as noted below.

- The old generateRequest and postRequest programs are superseded by a
new program called analyze. Analyze produces a binary output file,
which can be fed to identify, which generates and posts a corresponding
ID request.

- identify can read either a media file (as before) or the output of
the new analyze program.
 
- identify always emits JSON, unless there is an error that prevents
execution (such as missing libraries), in which case suitable error
messages are displayed).

- When an error is encountered, the messages to the console are no
longer cluttered with extra output such as patent information and the
usage instructions. If the syntax was wrong, the output says: 
'Type "./identify -?" to see instructions for correct usage.'

- JSON is written to stdout unless the -o option is provided to write
to a file.

- The JSON now includes a statusDescription field, containing a textual
interpretation of the number in the statusCode field.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 34.0e (for Linux)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- New config files are required for this version. If you haven't already 
been given a version 34 config file, please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.

- This release is called a "Cue ID" release. The Cue ID feature is
turned on by the configuration file. When an ID request results in a
match, Cue ID can extend the search forward and backward in the
unknown media file to find where the matching material actually begins
and ends. Cue ID also allows hopping through a media file and sending
ID requests at each new location, all from a single invocation of
identify.

- The release package no longer includes header files or programming
examples.  Customers use the prebuilt command-line program
identifyMediaFile.

- New documentation is included (AMCueID_Users_Guide.pdf).

- identifyMediaFile has new options (-H and -P) that allow ID requests
to be sent via Thrift to a customer's server that does the actual HTTP
posting.

- The generateRequest and postRequest programs are no longer included.

- The -e (assetID) flag for identifyMediaFile is now required.

- The -r flag for local lookup can be repeated multiple times.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 32.0 (for Linux and macOS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- New config files are required for this version. If you haven't already 
been given a version 32 config file, please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com.

- This is the first release to support "cover signatures." Cover
signatures permit the identification of cover songs (recordings that
might not themselves be registered in Audible Magic's database, but
whose music matches a registered composition, typically performed by a
different artist).  To identify cover songs, you will need a configuration 
file from Audible Magic that turns on this feature.

- The SDK documentation is now provided separately by Audible Magic’s
Client Services department. The file API_Users_Guide.pdf is no longer
included in the SDK release package.

- A bug has been fixed in the listenToSamples example program. It used
to crash when no local reference signature was specified but the
configuration file specified local lookup. A meaningful error message
is now given.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 31.0f (for Windows)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The listenToSamples executable is now built by examples-VS2010.sln.
(The source code and project files were already included but not built 
by the solution.)


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 31.0e (for Linux)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- No new features or bug fixes per se. This release was built using
the same code base as 31.0d, but it was built on CentOS 7.4, whereas
previous Linux releases were built on Ubuntu. 31.0d did not support
Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, because it was built with too new
a C library (glibc 2.18). 31.0e was built with glibc 2.17, which is
available on RHEL/CentOS 7.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 31.0d
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- New config files are required for this version, 
	Please contact helpdesk@audiblemagic.com to get a proper version 20 config file
	
- Mobile platforms (Android and iOS) are now supporting the new protocol buffer ID 
request and response format

- We have updated windows and linux releases to use libcurl 7.56.1 and openssl 1.1.0f.  
	We include these libraries with our packaging. You cannot use older 
	versions of openssl with this release of our SDK.  Newer versions should work, 
	but cannot be guaranteed to work. The macOS provides its own implementation of 
	ssl, so no openssl libs are shipped with that version.

- For Linux we've included gnutls and gcrypt shared libraries required by the cURL 
	library we distribute in the lib directory of the release package.
	
(Note that release candidates 31.0, 31.0a, 31.0b, and 31.0c were never distributed)


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 30.0h
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- identifyMediaFile takes two new optional parameters, for customers
  who need to send ID requests via a proxy:

     -p proxyURL (equivalent to curl's -x flag. The URL can end with a
        colon followed by a port number.
     -u userName:password (equivalent to curl's -U flag. libcurl will
        base64-encode the argument and put the result into a
        Proxy-Authorization HTTP header.)
      (-p and -u go hand in hand. If either -p or -u is supplied, the
      other must also be supplied.)

- Many cleanups and minor enhancements or bug fixes in examples/c_c++/.

- identifyNow did not get matches when the configuration specified a
  Duration greater than 25 seconds. The limit has been increased to 40
  seconds.

- identifyNow reported only "Match found." when it got a match. Now
  it gives more complete info, including the timing of the match.

- Removed unneeded "include <curl.h>" from example programs, which was
  causing build errors for some customers.
 
- The advanced programming example listenToSamples was changed so that
  it no longer uses the obsolete continuous lookup thread.

- Fixed bug where local lookups didn't fill in the status code.

- Added JSON output to the results of local lookups.

- Fixed memory leaks in the MFCBR library.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 30.0f (for Linux, Windows, and macOS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- ID requests and ID responses are now transmitted in a binary form
  instead of as XML. This cuts the network bandwidth for remote
  lookups approximately in half.

- As a result, the API for processing ID responses has completely
  changed; see the API User's Guide and MF_Media_api.h for details.

- The identifyFile command-line program has been replaced by
  identifyMediaFile, which has similar functionality but uses the new
  API.

- A JSON representation of the binary ID response has been added to
  identifyMediaFile and postRequest, and to corresponding API
  functions.

- generateRequest accepts new parameters (and equivalent ones are
  available in identifyMediaFile):
    -U URL (public URL of content to be identified, such as on a social
      media site)
    -T title (title of the content to be identified, such as might be
      displayed at that URL)
    -O otherText (descriptive text about the content, such as might be
      displayed at that URL)
  These parameters specify caller-supplied “metadata.” In the future,
  Audible Magic may use these fields for deeper inspection techniques.
  Corresponding arguments have been added to the API functions
  MFMediaID_GenerateRequest() and MFMediaID_IdentifyFile().

- The SDK now supports video signatures (fingerprints of visual data
  in video files), with or without an accompanying fingerprint of the
  audio data in the video file.  This feature is currently available
  only for remote lookups. Please contact Audible Magic if interested
  in this feature.

- The API User's Guide has been significantly changed, both in
  overview material and to reflect API changes.

- The continuousLookup example program, and the callback-based API it
  illustrated, have been removed.  Customers who used that API should
  instead call MFMedia_IdentifyNow() in a loop, as illustrated by the
  new -C flag in the identifyNow example program.

- Because it is for advanced use only, the listenToSamples
  command-line program has been removed from the SDK package, though
  its functionality is still available via the API. Customers who need
  listenToSamples may request it from Support.

- API changes (see MF_MediaID_api.h and the API User’s Guide for
  details):

  New typedefs:
  MFResponseRule, MFResponseContentCategory, MFResponseMediaType,
  MFLegalTextType.

  Obsolete typedefs:
  MFResponseStatus, MFMediaIDCallback.

  New functions:

  MFMediaIDRequest_GetBufferSize, MFMediaIDRequest_GetAsBuffer,
  MFMediaIDRequest_CreateUsingBuffer,
  MFMediaIDResponse_GetJSONBufferSize, MFMediaIDResponse_GetAsJSON,
  MFMediaIDResponse_GetNumberOfMatches,
  MFMediaIDResponse_GetMatchRule,
  MFMediaIDResponse_GetMatchContentCategory,
  MFMediaIdResponse_GetMatchMediaType,

  MFGetErrorDescription (Instead use MFError_GetDescription and
  MFError_GetCode.)

  MFMediaID_RegisterCallback (This had been replaced by
	  MFMediaID_RegisterIDResponseCallback, but that now is also
	  unsupported. The continuous lookup feature and its threaded
	  callback function are obsolete.  Instead, call
	  MFMediaID_IdentifyNow in a loop at the desired frequency.)

  MFMediaID_RetrieveDebugData, MFMediaID_ReleaseDebugData (Use
	  MFMediaID_SetKeepDebugData, MFMediaID_GetDebugData,
	  MFMediaIDDebugData_FillBuffers, and
	  MFMediaIDDebugData_Destroy.)

  MFMediaID_SetPrivateDataFolder (Use
  MFGlobalInit_WithPrivateDataFolder.)



Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Version 26.20 (Linux only)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This list only includes bug fixes or new features that are
applicable to Linux.

1. Fixed a performance problem seen when generating ID requests that
had a large offset value (as specified in the license key or
configuration file). The symptom was that computation time (when
generating a signature from a media file) was roughly proportional to
the offset size.

NOTE: The fix involves a compromise in which some media file formats
(notably Windows Media video, WMV) typically have reduced timing
accuracy in terms of the begin and end time of the signature. In our
tests, WMV files were often decoded to temporary audio files that
began 3-4 seconds later than the specified offset and ended 1 second
earlier than specified by the duration. We recommend that customers,
especially those using WMV files, who are currently using large
offsets (currently defined as >100 seconds) instead extract the
desired segment from the media file, write it to a new media file, and
feed this new, short file to our API.

2. Changed the loading of the curl, crypto, and ssl libraries from
static to dynamic (on Unix-based desktop platforms). This allows
applications that are generating, but not posting, ID requests to run on
computers where these libraries are not installed. (For an example of
how to compile your application to take advantage of the dynamic
loading capability, please refer to the "generateRequest" target in
oemExamples/c_c++/Makefile.) On the other hand, these libraries must
be installed for any application that requires the OEM SDK to do HTTP
communication (such as for sending authorization or identification
requests to Audible Magic's servers).

3. Changed the behavior of API such as MFMediaID_IdentifyFile() and
MFMediaID_IdentifyNow() that takes an MFMediaIDResponse* parameter, to
better handle cases when the ID server returns well-formed XML that
reports an error condition. Formerly, the API returned an error and
the MFMediaIDResponse was not available for inspection. Now, the API
returns MF_SUCCESS, and the SDK client application should call
MFMediaIDResponse_GetIDStatus(); the application may also call
MFMediaIDResponse_GetAsString() if inspecting the XML for details is
desired.

4. Improved sample programs' parsing of command-line arguments, to
report an error when encountering unexpected words in command line.

5. Added ffprobe executable. Media files' formats, codecs, etc. are
now detected using ffprobe instead of ffmpeg, because ffprobe's output
can be parsed more reliably. (The ffmpeg executable is still used for
decoding media files.)


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Release Version 26.0c
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Removed dependency of the ffmpeg executable on the following
third-party libraries: libiconv, libSDL.


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Release Version 26.0a
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed a problem (present in all previous releases) that was
confusing some customers, when the sample apps (desktops only)
returned an exit code whose value was greater than 255, which the
shell then changed to the value mod 256. The fix was to change the
sample apps to output a final return code of either 0 (for success) or
1 (for failure), instead of an MFError code. Customers who wish to
report a problem encountered when running one of the sample
applications are required to include the application's full error
description and MFError code, as written to STDERR, in the incident
report that they file with Audible Magic Support. See the end of
main() in the sample C programs for more insight.

2. Reduced the number of shared libraries that were required by ffmpeg
in the previous SDK release (26.0). 


Bug Fixes and Features Implemented in Release Version 26.0
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Created 64-bit Windows build. 

2. Discontinued 32-bit releases on Linux and Windows. If you need releases
for these platforms, contact Audible Magic's Support department.

3. Added new command-line applications, generateRequest and postRequest, to replace
the media2xml and postXML legacy applications.

4. Discontinued identifyFileWithOffset application. Added offset seconds as command-line
option to identifyFile application.

5. Added MFMediaID_SetOffset API. Documented in the "Advanced API Functions" section of 
the API Users Guide.

6. Discontinued use of FFMPEG libraries (libavcodec, etc.) and ffmpeg-lastResort
executable. Now ships with ffmpeg executable only (updated to a 2015 version).
